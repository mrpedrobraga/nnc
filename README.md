In the `nnc` executable there is everything you need to make nano programs: A compiler, debugging tools, linter, LSP server and a nano library you can import for your metaprogramming needs.

## Usage

Execute

```bash
$ nnc compile <filename>
```

on the folder where your &lt;filename&gt; file is.

Instead of having lots of compilation flags, compilation details are specified via nano annotations inside your code.

It's recommended to have an entry file (call it `index.nano`) with your compilation parameters, which then calls your entry point function.

```nano
#%compilation.output {
  windows_x86: 'dist/program.exe'
  nbbc: 'dist/program.nb8'
  wasm: 'program.wasm'
}

#%optimization {
  keep_symbol_names: yes
  force_always_inline: yes
}

#%also_include [
  "/lib/*"
]

import 'src/main.nano' as entry_point
entry_point.main()
```

## Installation

`nnc` is portable, just call it from the CLI.

Maybe put it somewhere on your PATH, idk.
